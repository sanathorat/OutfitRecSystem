## Project Overview
- Developed using the Fashion MNIST dataset with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in TensorFlow and Keras.  
- Accurately classifies images across 10 fashion categories: T-shirt, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, and Ankle boot.  
- Implements a style-based recommendation engine that maps items into categories such as casual, formal, sporty, and party.  
- Provides visual predictions and outfit previews using Matplotlib.  
- Designed with a modular structure for easy experimentation and extension.
